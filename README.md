# iOS-Easy-Task
Using the latest version of Xcode, create an app that has one button. When the button is pressed, the current temperature in Houston Texas is shown in a text field. By current temperature, we mean the temperature when we run your app.

# Your comments or assumptions
Initial completion of task did not allow the user to get the current temperature while the application was already running; updated version adds this functionality.
